This blog post will discuss the implementation of a chatbot for answering questions about the contents of the Plan and Building Law using Streamlit and OpenAI. The chatbot uses the OpenAI language model and the Chroma vector store for document retrieval. The application allows the user to configure the language model, the system message, the type of retriever, and the granularity of the document retrieval. The user can also reload the language model and clear the message history. The chatbot responds to user input and saves the conversation history.

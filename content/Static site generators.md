**Teach me about static site generators**

Certainly! Static site generators are a category of tools that allow you to generate a complete website based on raw data, such as markdown files, and templates. As the name implies, the output of these generators is static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This is in contrast to dynamic websites where content is generated on-the-fly for each request, often involving a database query.

**Advantages of Static Websites:**

1. **Performance:** Since there's no need to query a database or execute server-side code for each visitor, static sites generally load very quickly.

2. **Security:** Without a database or server-side processing, there's a reduced attack surface. This can make static sites less vulnerable to certain types of web attacks.

3. **Scalability:** Static sites can be easily distributed and cached on Content Delivery Networks (CDN), making it easier to handle large amounts of traffic.

4. **Maintenance:** Without the need for server-side scripting or databases, maintenance overhead can be reduced.

**Popular Static Site Generators:**

1. **Jekyll:** Written in Ruby, it's one of the oldest and most popular static site generators. Jekyll is often associated with GitHub Pages, where it's supported natively.

2. **Hugo:** Written in Go, Hugo is known for its speed. Its rich set of features and themes make it a favorite among many developers.

3. **Gatsby:** Uses React to generate static sites. It can pull data from various sources, including markdown files, APIs, and databases, and uses GraphQL for data querying.

4. **Hexo:** A fast, simple, and powerful blogging framework powered by Node.js.

5. **Pelican:** Written in Python, so given your proficiency, it might appeal to you! It converts Markdown or reStructuredText content to static files.

**General Workflow with Static Site Generators:**

1. **Content Creation:** Write your content, usually in Markdown or another lightweight markup language.

2. **Configuration:** Configure site metadata, layout preferences, and any plugins or extensions.

3. **Template Design:** Design templates to dictate how your content should be presented. Most generators use a templating engine to help with this.

4. **Build:** Use the static site generator to build your site. This will generate a folder full of static assets (HTML, CSS, JS).

5. **Deployment:** Deploy the generated assets to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.

**Some Additional Points:**

- Given your background in data science and Python, you might find value in experimenting with data visualization libraries (like D3.js) in combination with static site generators. This could allow you to display complex datasets in an easily digestible and web-friendly format.
  
- Static site generators can be integrated with headless CMS platforms. This approach allows content creators to manage content without needing to understand the technical aspects of the site, while developers can focus on the code and templates.

While static sites have their advantages, they may not be suitable for all applications. If your website requires real-time updates, user accounts, or other dynamic features, a fully-fledged web framework or a hybrid approach might be more appropriate. However, for blogs, documentation, and many other types of websites, static site generators can be an excellent choice.
